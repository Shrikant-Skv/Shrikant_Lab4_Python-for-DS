### Learning outcomes:
* Exploratory data analysis and data preparation for model building.
* PCA for dimensionality reduction.
* K-means and Agglomerative Clustering

### Objective:
* Based on the given marketing campaign dataset, segment the similar customers into suitable clusters. Analyze the clusters and provide your insights to help the organization promote their business.

### Context:
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.
Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
